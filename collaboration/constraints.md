# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## External


- **Timing Constraints:** The team was distributed across multiple time zones.
Scheduling meetings and achieving real-time collaboration were difficult.
Tasks that required input from multiple members often took longer due to delayed
communication.

## Internal: Involuntary

- **Familiarity with GitHub:** Some team members were unfamiliar with GitHub
workflows, such as branching, merging, and resolving conflicts. We had to take some
time for each of us to be acquainted with the tool more and leverage it in our works
for maximum efficiency.
- **Knowledge Gap in Programming:** The team had varying levels of programming
expertise. Some members were proficient in the required technologies,
while others were still learning. This knowledge disparity created dependencies
where experienced members had to spend additional time mentoring or reviewing
code, slowing down overall progress.

## Internal: Voluntary

- **Coding Style & Conventions:** Eventhough we were given some extension to help with 
conventions and styles, it was little bit hectic in the beginning as most of us were new
to the linting and naming variables conventions.
- **Skill Development:** There was some programming knowledge gap when we started but through
collaboration and thanks to apps like slack we were able to help each other through the journey.
