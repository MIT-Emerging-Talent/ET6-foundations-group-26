# üöß Project Constraints

Every project operates within boundaries that define its possibilities and
challenges. Constraints guide decisions, shape project goals, and encourage
innovation by pushing us to solve problems creatively within set limitations.
This document outlines both **external constraints** (factors beyond our
control) and **internal constraints** (team-specific challenges, both
involuntary and voluntary) to provide a clear framework for delivering a
successful project.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è External Constraints

External constraints are shaped by factors outside the team's control and
require adaptability to overcome.

- **Connectivity Issues**:  
  Unreliable internet access and occasional power outages can disrupt
  workflows and delay progress.  

- **Competing Responsibilities**:  
  Many team members are balancing other commitments, such as jobs or
  studies, limiting their availability.

## üîê Internal Constraints

### Involuntary Constraints

These are inherent challenges within the team that require proactive
management.

- **Familiarity with GitHub**:  
  Some team members were unfamiliar with workflows such as branching,
  merging, and resolving conflicts. Extra time was needed to ensure everyone
  could use these tools effectively.  

- **Knowledge Gaps in Programming**:  
  The team has varying levels of programming expertise. Experienced members
  often mentor others or review code, slowing overall progress but fostering
  collaboration and learning.  

- **Time Availability**:  
  Team members have differing schedules, limiting overlapping working hours.
  The team primarily works asynchronously, with weekly meetings to stay
  aligned.

### Voluntary Constraints

These are self-imposed guidelines designed to improve quality, focus, and
workflow efficiency.

- **Coding Style & Conventions**:  
  Adjusting to linting tools and variable naming conventions was initially
  challenging, but the team adapted and maintained consistency throughout the
  project.  

- **Skill Development**:  
  Addressing knowledge gaps was a priority. Collaboration tools like Slack
  helped team members learn from one another and improve collectively.  

- **Scope Management**:  
  Focus remained on essential deliverables, avoiding unnecessary complexity
  or scope creep.  

- **Quality Standards**:  
  The team committed to clean coding, thorough documentation, and rigorous
  testing using `pytest`. All pull requests must pass CI checks before
  merging.  

- **Communication**:  
  Slack and GitHub project boards were used for asynchronous communication,
  supplemented by weekly Google Meet progress meetings.

## üöÄ Call to Action

Constraints are opportunities for growth and innovation. If challenges arise:

1. **Raise an Issue**: Communicate the problem promptly.  
2. **Collaborate**: Work together to find solutions.  
3. **Adapt**: Stay flexible and focused to navigate obstacles effectively.  

By working within these boundaries, the team can deliver a meaningful and
impactful project on time.
